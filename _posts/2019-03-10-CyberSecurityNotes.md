Current mode of communication relies on the transmission of data through computer systems and networks. Most of our daily activities like sending emails, browsing social media, online banking and shopping depend on these telecommunication platforms and the world wide web. More and more vital information and personal data are integrated in these network making privacy a serious concern. These security issues emphasize the need of a reliable method of protecting our information from unauthorized use and processing.

<h3>Introduction Information Security</h3>

C - confidentiality

is defined as the attribute of an information that is accessible only to authorized entity.

I - integrity

is defined as the attribute of an information that is robust to modification of outside entity.

A - availability

is defined as the attribute of an information that is accessible to the intended user.

<h3>Terms</h3>

**Denial of Service**

when users cannot access the network or specific services provided on the network.

**Authentication**

is proving that a user is the person he or she claims to be.

**Authorization**

In a nutshell **InfoSec** pertains to:

-they can trust the information they use.

**Backup Your Files**

The golden rule for backing up is the 3-2-1 rule

3 - Keep **3** copies of any important file: 1 primary and 2 backups.

2 - Keep the files on **2** different media types to protect against types of hazards.

1 - Store **1** copy offsite (e.g., outside your home or business facility)

*Use cloud storage*

pro: 3rd party maintains and protect your data from malware and natural disasters. accessibility anytime. cheap as you dont need to buy physical storage

con: dependent on internet connection. there will be some delay between you and the cloud. You may locked into one provider. jurisdiction problems when critical data is hosted to some geographically restricting areas. you don't know the entire cloud infrastructure.


carefully check the service agreement of the cloud provider. make sure that your data will be encrypted with established encryption algorithms Advanced Encription Standard (AES) or Blowfish. Trasnfer data via secure socket layer (SSL) connection. Use firewall. Physically protect the hardware that stores, process and transmit your data.

*hard and solid state drive*

pro: you can quickly update backup files

con: rolling backup can cause malware propagation and eventually corruption of files. it can be physically damaged or stolen. lifespan varies. they can be rendered unusable via magnetic degaussing.

always encrypt, secure physical computer. use firewall and anti Virus

*Removable Storage media*

pro: flexible, potable, versatile storage sizes, reusable

con: prone to loss and theft, and also malware propagation leading to corruption.

you are more responsible for physically protecting the device. password protect them, encrypt their data, connect them only to systems that follow network security protocols, firewall and anti-virus

SSDs have no moving parts and not magnetic so not in danger of daguassing.

**Email Scams**

Filter spam. •Don’t trust unsolicited email. •Treat email attachments with caution. •Don’t click links in email messages. •Install antivirus software and keep it up to date. •Install a personal firewall and keep it up to date. •Configure your email client for security.
