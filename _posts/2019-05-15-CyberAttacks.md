Since late December of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019,
various websites of organizations in the Philippines composed
of alternative media, human rights organizations, journalists
associations, etc. have been under sustained CyberAttacks in
the form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
This is now confirmed as reported in the forensic investigation
recently released by Sweden-based Qurium Media Foundation [[1](https://www.qurium.org/alerts/philippines/attributing-the-attacks-against-media-human-rigths-philippines?fbclid=IwAR1cFkKkhP55fRifbdHZ_SjE0Mg_myW8qfZe80dJULV2ZVDXfmv0fNUOVbw)].

According to their report, exposed IP addresses of the attackers
trace them to IP Converge Data Services and Suniway Group
of Companies. Both are cloud and internet service providers
physically based in Manila and Hong Kong respectively. Their
initial attacks are backed up by political motivation based
from the message trail from their conversations.

DDos is a type of CyberAttack that attempts to overload a
system and eventually shut it down. Shutting down the websites
of alternative media and progressive organizations will deny
audiences of legitimate reports.

One common denominator why these organizations were targeted
for attack is their critical stance against the Duterte regime.
These organizations have voiced out and believe that these
attacks are part of Duterte’s regime to stifle press freedom
and fortify his dictatorship rule. As much has been deduced by
the Quirium report.

On a positive note, we extend gratitude to Quirium Media
Foundation for proactively backing up peoples’ organizations
and therefore strengthening international solidarity among
advocates fighting against unwarranted censorship and
dissent suppression.

The Computer Professionals’ Union encourages individuals,
organizations and advocates from the IT sector to stand against
political repression and CyberAttacks that stifle legitimate dissent.
We urge our fellow techs to join us in advocating for technology
in the service of the Filipino people.
