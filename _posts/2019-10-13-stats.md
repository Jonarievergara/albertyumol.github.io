In the recent decade, we have produced the majority of our data due to increased in computing powers of our machines, increase in volume of our storage systems and the decrease in the cost of technology making it accessible to a lot more people.

But data is just that - data. For us to get insights, we need to process.

Take as an example the qualifying entrance exam for **Eskwelabs**. Assume that there are 50 items for the exam with 100 examinees. You have already learned by now how to generate synthetic data in Python. Now we generate the scores randomly and visualize using a bar plot hoping that no one scores below 50.

Here is how you do it in Python:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/albertyumol/95649098fa8c08dd58ce5e966b57b886.js"></script>

And here is the resulting distribution:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/stat/eskwelabs_score.png" alt="Eskwelabs scores." class="center">
{: refdef}

Visualizing can give us a feel of what the data looks like. We can see that one student actually perfected the exam (**maximum**) and the lowest score is around 25 (**minimum**). From these we can tell that the scores **ranges** from 25-50.

Most of the time, visualizing data is not enough to get insights. That is where statistics comes in.

Statistics refers to the mathematical methods and techniques to gain insights from data. I know you already did some statistics before. So this should be easy breezy.

The three most common tool used in data description is what we call the measures of central tendency.

<h2>Measures of Central Tendencies</h2>

In exploratory our data sets, we want to check the average or central values of our data. Centrality can be measured by these 3 values: mean, median, and mode.

**Mean** <br>

The mean gives you an initial summary of your data set. It is obtained by getting the sum of the individual data points $$x_{i}$$ and divide this sum by the total number of data points $$N$$.

Mathematically:

$$
\begin{equation}
\overline x = \sum_{i}^{N} \frac {x_i}{N}
\end{equation}
$$

Programmatically in Python:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/albertyumol/a532da3d311d913247111c2485096231.js"></script>

Calculation the mean exam scores of Eskwelabs applicants, we find that the average score is $$36.9$$ which is $$73.8%$$. Not bad if the exam is difficult. This value somewhat gives us an idea of how the examinees performed overall in the exam.

Another measure of central tendency is the median.

**Median**

The median is the middle value of the data set when you sort out every single points from lowest to highest. The most common approach in obtaining the median value is by considering two cases: when the length of data set $$N$$ is odd or even.

When $$N$$ is odd, it is not divisible by two thus we obtain a unique middle value.

Mathematically:

$$
\begin{equation}
M_{odd} = \left( \frac {N+1}{N} \right) ^{th} term
\end{equation}
$$

The other case is when $$N$$ is even which implies that there are two candidate values for the median. What you do is get the average of these two points.

Mathematically:

$$
\begin{equation}
M_{even} = \frac {\left( \frac {N}{2} \right) ^{th} term + \left( \frac {N}{2} + 1 \right) ^{th} term}{2}
\end{equation}
$$

Implementing both this equations in Python:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/albertyumol/15011622fbd3747ae541f45b5814b002.js"></script>

If you are keen enough to notice, in our mathematical equation for the even case we add 1 to the middle value but when we implemented in code we change it by subtracting one. This is because in Python, we start counting from 0 so we need to account for this translation.

The median score for the Eskwelabs exam data set is 37 which is not far from the mean. As we have observed, the median is a bit more complex



on the computation side compared to the mean that's why the latter is used more frequently. There are other ways to calculate the median without sorting. Check this out:

[Sorting Less Median Calculation](https://medium.com/@nxtchg/calculating-median-without-sorting-eaa639cedb9f)

The problem with the mean is that it is very sensitive to outliers unlike the median. So if your analysis requires sensitivity accounting to outliers the median is the better option.

To do a little of side track, median is part of a more generalized data descriptors called the quantiles. Basically quantiles just divide the data set in equal proportions. The median 2-quantile is the middle value when the data set is divided into two equal proportions.





mode <br>





(Assuming as well that you know some basic Python.)

~~~Python
import random
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

random.seed( 30 )
n = 12
y = []
for i in range(n):
    y += [random.randint(15, 30)]

z = pd.DataFrame(y)
z[1] = z.index + 1
z = z[[1,0]]
z.columns = ['Month', 'Temperature']
plt.bar(z['Month'], z['Temperature'])
~~~

***change lables to actial months and polish the storyline***



**insert code here**






Develop a storyline.


Statistics has two main branch, univariate and multivariate.

For this module, our focus is on univariate statistics.

Testing if my math equations will load

$$\nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x})$$

$$R_0$$



Testing another equation

$$
\begin{equation}
SE(\hat{p_1}-\hat{p_2}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_{combined}(1-\hat{p}_{combined})}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_{combined}(1-\hat{p}_{combined})}{n_2}}
\end{equation}
$$



SCRATCH:
Editing stat article ().

This is a guide on Markdown [Stat][1].

we generated majority of our data. We have become walking data sets with the technologies that we use constantly emitting metadata.

Not only around us but we also generate a lot of data. Through our mobile phones and wearable tech such as smart watches and other smarts whatsoever.


We consider to cases when calculating the median of a data set. The first is when the number of data points is odd. This means that this number is not divisible by **two**, meaning it has a unique middle value. This unique middle value is the median. The other case is when the number of the data points is even, implying that the number of data points is divisible by two. There are two candidates for the median. What we do is we get the average of these points. Here is how we do it in Python.
