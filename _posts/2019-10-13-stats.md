<s>hello, world</s>

Data is around us. Not only around us but we also generate a lot of data. Through our mobile phones and wearable tech such as smart watches and other smarts whatsoever.


Let us start by generating random data. In Python, we do it by:

**insert code here**

data is just that data. To get insights we need to describe and interpret it. We call it Statistics.

Statistics is not only inseparable with data science, **it is one of the core**. In simple terms, it refers to mathematical methods and techniques to gain insights from data. How do we make statistics lesson more fun? huhuhu





Develop a storyline.


Statistics has two main branch, univariate and multivariate.

For this module, our focus is on univariate statistics.

Testing if my math equations will load

$$\nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x})$$

$$R_0$$

**Measures of Central Tendencies**

In exploratory data analysis, we want to check the average or central values of our data. Centrality can be measured by these 3 values.

mean <br>

The mean is the most common metric used. (list advantages and disadvantages, sample code and sample problem) it gives an initial glance of a distribution.

median <br>
mode <br>

Testing another equation

$$
\begin{equation}
SE(\hat{p_1}-\hat{p_2}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_{combined}(1-\hat{p}_{combined})}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_{combined}(1-\hat{p}_{combined})}{n_2}}
\end{equation}
$$
