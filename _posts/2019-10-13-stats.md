This will be a dump of a draft for a basic statistics module for data scientists.

Statistics is not only inseparable with data science. **It is one of the core**. In simple terms, it refers to mathematical methods and techniques to gain insights from data.

Outline
(1) Measures of Central Tendencies <br> <br>
(2) Measures of Dispersion <br> <br>
(3) Correlation and Causation <br> <br>
(4) Probability <br>
  (a) Dependence and Independence <br>
  (b) Conditional Probability <br>
  (c) Baye's Theorem <br>
  (d) Random Variables <br>
  (e) Continuous distributions <br>
  (f) Normal distribution <br>
  (g) Central Limit Theorem <br> <br>
(5) Hypothesis and interference <br>
  (a) Confidence interval <br>
  (b) Bayesian inference <br>


Statistics has two main branch, univariate and multivariate.

For this module, our focus is on univariate statistics.

Testing if my math equations will load

$$\nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x})$$
