Data science is a very powerful tool that can guide our understanding of real world events. In times of crisis, we may get confused and emotional. Data science gives us a lense to be objective. It introduces concrete solutions to concrete material conditions. It is a science after all which follows sound logic, is repeatable, and insightful.

This article is to give you an idea of the data science process in conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA). The context is using the nCov data from DOH (found here [COVID-19 Philippines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16g_PUxKYMC0XjeEKF6FPUBq2-pFgmTkHoj5lbVrGLhE/edit?fbclid=IwAR1qRr3hTxSiQ8KdymZiIQfPX4CpSA4VezpNKqXIPCIMQI1H3xMTGJ16lMs#gid=0)) and population data from PSA (found here [Total population by age group, sex, region](http://openstat.psa.gov.ph/PXWeb/pxweb/en/DB/DB__1A__PO/1001A6DTPR0.px/?rxid=7513be1c-0ada-4a03-909c-6f03e8b2d402&fbclid=IwAR1Vcfp-d-cfIF_ujsyDJICUCL6zPpTNS-51E5K8rFj373XzB_v7kbTllzE)).

This is all done in Python using a Jupyter Notebook with the basic tools of data wrangling, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

Data from DOH is in a spreadsheet format so when you import it please make sure you have the proper Google APIs enabled.

We will not try to predict anything. We should leave it to the epidemiologists and experts whose been doing it for their entire careers. I will link some their works below. I will also list down the efforts in the Philippines using data science to help with the Corona Crisis.

### Importing data

First I used the libraries `gspread` and `oauth2client` to access the spreadsheet. You can also download the spreadsheet as a CSV and import using the standard pd.read_csv. The advantage of the method that I used is that everytime I run the code, it will fetch the latest numbers from the spreadsheet as compared to downloading the CSV everytime for an updated dataset.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/1.png" alt="1" class="center">
{: refdef}

Here are the columns indicated in the spreadsheet.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/2.png" alt="2" class="center">
{: refdef}

### Asking questions of the data

Suppose that we are interested with the running total of cases in the Philippines as of March 31, 2020, we can run:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/3.png" alt="3" class="center">
{: refdef}

Now, the goal of our EDA is to breakdown this number. Let us look first at the binned age distribution.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/4.png" alt="4" class="center">
{: refdef}

The average age of nCov positive patients is around 54. The distribution is near symmetric at the 60 age mark. This is interesting to see this because the population of the Philippines is young. In fact [89.35%](https://www.indexmundi.com/philippines/age_structure.html) of Filipinos are aged 55 and below. This tells us that there is indeed a significant number of older people that gets infected by the corona virus.

Now when we look at gender,

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/gender1.png" alt="gender" class="center">
{: refdef}

We see that around $$62%$$ are male. We can only infer certain reasons to this. Maybe males are more exposed in the nature of their jobs or maybe it can also be attributed to sanitation and personal [hygene](https://www.nst.com.my/world/world/2020/03/572170/men-worse-bathroom-hygiene-prevents-covid-19).

It's easier to interpret if gender and age group and age group is visualized together.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/combined_age_gender.png" alt="mix" class="center">
{: refdef}

Then again, people in statistics have a better way of doing this through a pyramid plot. In the case of the Philippines,

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/pyramid_PH.png" alt="pyramid" class="center">
{: refdef}

The first three cases of the virus are from Chinese nationals.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/china.png" alt="china" class="center">
{: refdef}


It might be interesting to see if other nationalities have been infected with the corona virus inside the PH.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/nation.png" alt="nation" class="center">
{: refdef}

Indeed, we see that that is the case. Although majority of the cases are now Filipinos there are foreign nationals as well who have been tested positive inside the Philippines.

Given these insights, it is logical for us to ask,

### How did they acquired Corona?

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/travel.png" alt="travel" class="center">
{: refdef}

We see that around $$72%$$ of those who tested positive didn't have recent/relevant travel history. This confirms the statement of the experts that community transmission is already happening.

Interestingly, in the study of disease spread epidemiologists always factor in links. You will have a high likelihood of contracting the disease if interacted someone who contracted the disease. Plotting the patient links in our data set,

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/link.png" alt="link" class="center">
{: refdef}

An alarming 97% has no link to previous patient. This tells us that the current contact tracing is not as efficient as we are not able to monitor the spread of the disease. Given this scenario, the focus of the officials should be already on containing those who tested positive and empowering frontline workers by providing support and resources. (Note: This number includes those that are for validation so definitely this is an overestimate. But given the weight of the matter (and the clock is ticking), an overestimate is better than an underestimate as we are not already able to confirm information in real time.)

Most of the locations of the patients are concentrated in Metro Manila.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/loc.png" alt="loc" class="center">
{: refdef}

But it is starting to trickle down to the provinces.

### Evolutions through time

On a more optimistic note, we see the count of new cases decreasing as of the week of this posting,

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/new_cases.png" alt="new_cases" class="center">
{: refdef}

For us to see the pattern better, we can look at the cumulative count of cases,

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/cummul1.png" alt="cummul1" class="center">
{: refdef}

This tells us that although the numbers are increasing, the rate at which they increase are losing momentum which is a good indication.

We can also look at the number of deaths and recoveries per day,

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/rec_died.png" alt="rec died" class="center">
{: refdef}

Again cummulatively,

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/rec_died_cummul.png" alt="rec died cummul" class="center">
{: refdef}


Since, the Philippines is still at the onset of its experience with the corona crisis relative to China and South Korea, the number of deaths per day are more significant compared to the number of recoveries per day. This is expected as this pattern was also evident to the case of China and South Korea. We should expect however, the effect of the enhanced community quarantine to reflect on the numbers after one month.

### What's next?

We just imported and took a look at what's in the PH COVID-19 data set using python. That was a quick tour of the basic EDA process that we do in Data Science. I strongly recommend you peruse the documentation of the libraries we used, learn about all of the other handy functions that these tool provides, and explore further questions that you have for the data set.

You can also apply this process to other future projects that you plan to do.
