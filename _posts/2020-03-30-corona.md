Data science is a very powerful tool that can guide our understanding of real world events. In times of crisis, we may get confused and emotional. Data science gives us a lense to be objective. It introduces concrete solutions to concrete material conditions. It is a science after all which follows sound logic, is repeatable, and insightful.

This article is to give you an idea of the data science process in conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA). The context is using the nCov data from DOH (found here [COVID-19 Philippines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16g_PUxKYMC0XjeEKF6FPUBq2-pFgmTkHoj5lbVrGLhE/edit?fbclid=IwAR1qRr3hTxSiQ8KdymZiIQfPX4CpSA4VezpNKqXIPCIMQI1H3xMTGJ16lMs#gid=0)) and population data from PSA (found here [Total population by age group, sex, region](http://openstat.psa.gov.ph/PXWeb/pxweb/en/DB/DB__1A__PO/1001A6DTPR0.px/?rxid=7513be1c-0ada-4a03-909c-6f03e8b2d402&fbclid=IwAR1Vcfp-d-cfIF_ujsyDJICUCL6zPpTNS-51E5K8rFj373XzB_v7kbTllzE)).

This is all done in Python using a Jupyter Notebook with the basic tools of data wrangling, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

Data from DOH is in a spreadsheet format so when you import it please make sure you have the proper Google APIs enabled.

We will not try to predict anything. We should leave it to the epidemiologists and experts whose been doing it for their entire careers. I will link some their works below. I will also list down the efforts in the Philippines using data science to help with the Corona Crisis.

### Importing data

First I used the libraries `gspread` and `oauth2client` to access the spreadsheet. You can also download the spreadsheet as a CSV and import using the standard pd.read_csv. The advantage of the method that I used is that everytime I run the code, it will fetch the latest numbers from the spreadsheet as compared to downloading the CSV everytime for an updated dataset.

{: refdef}

Here are the columns indicated in the spreadsheet.

### Asking questions of the data

Suppose that we are interested with the running total of cases in the Philippines as of March 31, 2020, we can run:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/3.png" alt="3" class="center">
{: refdef}

Now, the goal of our EDA is to breakdown this number. Let us look first at the binned age distribution.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eda_corona/4.png" alt="4" class="center">
{: refdef}

The average age of nCov positive patients is around 54. The distribution is near symmetric at the 60 age mark. This is interesting to see this because the population of the Philippines is young. In fact [89.35%](https://www.indexmundi.com/philippines/age_structure.html) of Filipinos are aged 55 and below. This tells us that there is indeed a significant number of older people that gets infected by the corona virus.



also tells us that the age is spread uniformly for ages <55 and >55.



### What's next?


We just imported and took a look at what's in the PH COVID-19 data set using python. That was a quick tour of the basic EDA process that we do in Data Science. I strongly recommend you peruse the documentation of the libraries we used, learn about all of the other handy functions that these tool provides, and explore further questions that you have for the data set.

You can also apply this process to other future projects that you plan to do.
