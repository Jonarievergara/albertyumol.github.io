Data science is a very powerful tool that can guide our understanding of real world events. In times of crisis, we may get confused and emotional. Data science gives as a lense to be objective. It introduces concrete solutions to concrete material conditions. It is a science after all which follows sound logic, is repeatable, and insightful.

This article is to give you an idea of the data science process in conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA). The context is using the nCov data from DOH (found here [COVID-19 Philippines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16g_PUxKYMC0XjeEKF6FPUBq2-pFgmTkHoj5lbVrGLhE/edit?fbclid=IwAR1qRr3hTxSiQ8KdymZiIQfPX4CpSA4VezpNKqXIPCIMQI1H3xMTGJ16lMs#gid=0)) and population data from PSA (found here).

This is all done in Python using a Jupyter Notebook using the basic tools of data wrangling, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

Data from DOH is in a spreadsheet format so when you import it please make sure you have the proper Google APIs enabled.

We will not try to predict anything. We should leave it to the epidemiologists and experts whose been doing it for their entire careers. I will link some their works below. I will also list down the efforts in the Philippines using data science to help with the Corona Crisis.

First I used the libraries `gspread` and `oauth2client` to access the spreadsheet. You can also download the spreadsheet as a CSV and import using the standard pd.read_csv. The advantage of the method that I used is that everytime I run the code, it will fetch the latest numbers from the spreadsheet as compared to downloading the CSV everytime for an updated dataset.
