Note: This is assuming the reader already knows basic statistics.

**Time Series** is a collection of observations made sequentially through time.

**Definition of Terms**

**continuous time series**
are time series whose observations are made continuously through time. This type can also be used when the measured variable can only take a discrete set of values.

**discrete time series**
are time series whose observations are taken only at specific times, usually equally spaced. This type can also be used when the measured variable is a continuous variable.

**point process**
are series of events occuring 'randomly' through time.

**sampled time series**
are digitized version of continuous time series sampled at equal intervals of time to give a discrete time series.

When successive observations are dependent, future values may be predicted from past observations.

**deterministic time series**
are time series that can be *predicted exactly* from precious observations.

**stochastic time series**
are time series that can be *predicted only partly* from precious observations. This entails thinking of future values as having a probability distribution.

**robust**
insensitivity to outliers.

**objective of time series analysis**
+ description
    - **time plot** observations against time. First step in analyzing a time series to obtain a simple descriptive measures of the main properties of the series.
+ explanation
    - **linear system** converts an input series into an output series by a linear operation.
+ prediction
+ control
