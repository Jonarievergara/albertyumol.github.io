It has been a while since my last post. The corona crisis really altered my schedule and plans. But we need to adapt, move forward and proceed to our new normal. I am lucky right now that I am able to write again, be able to breathe freely.

To the reader, sending you virtual hugs. I know that we are in rough times, but this too shall pass.

This post is a demonstration I use in my Web Scraping class for Eskwelabs. The goal is to scrape facebook posts (your own) and make a `Word Cloud` from it.

Data Science is not only about fancy algorithms, statistics and math. It is also about credibly sourcing your data. Given that the bulk of data is in the internet hiding in the backend or scattered in the frontend of websites, web scraping is indeed a handy technique.

The [Cambridge Analytica Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal) took its toll and changed the data mining landscape to a more stricter sense. Personal data of millions of Facebook users where scraped and used without consent for political advertising and campaign.

It was a good thing that in 2018, the European Union pushed through implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that puts privacy of people with their digital data at a premium.

Because of this a lot of companies mandated that their users will have the option to download their personal data (although it is unclear if these data is complete). At the very least we have a sense of ownership and visibility to our own data. If ever Facebook sells my info at least I know what info they got from me. And maybe reverse engineer their methods and find the truth.

### Step 1: Download Facebook Data
Log-in to your facebook account. Go to settings and click download your information.


{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fb/fb_1.png" alt="download_info" class="center">
{: refdef}

For the purposes of this tutorial/demo, we are only interested in your posts. So untick all check boxes except for posts.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fb/fb_2.png" alt="posts" class="center">
{: refdef}

Here are the specs:
- Date Range: All of my data
- Format: HTML
- Media Quality: Low (for faster download, we are interested to text anyways)

Click create file. You will be notified when it is ready to download. You will be prompted to download a zip file. Download and unzip it.

Open the unzipped folder, find the posts folder and locate the `your_posts_1.html` file.


{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fb/fb_3.png" alt="posts_html" class="center">
{: refdef}

Now let's do us some Python üòÅ

You need to install [BeautifulSoup](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/beautifulsoup4) and [WordCloud](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/wordcloud)

We now use beautiful soup to make a hot fudge of html mess.

To get the text of posts that I posted, let us check first the source code using my favorite browser's (MOZILLA FIREFOX) inspector. Right click on a post and click inspect element (or whatever counterpart you have with your browser but I say switch to FIREFOX, the most secure browser)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fb/fb_4.png" alt="inspect" class="center">
{: refdef}


Navigate along and do some pattern recognition to identify the correct class to filter. My guess would be `_2pin`.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fb/fb_5.png" alt="filter" class="center">
{: refdef}





we can clean out noise in the string. Technically we call them `stop words`.
