It has been a while since my last post. The corona crisis really altered my schedule and plans. But we need to adapt, move forward and proceed to our new normal. I am lucky right now that I am able to write again, be able to breathe freely.

To the reader, sending you virtual hugs. I know that we are in rough times, but this too shall pass.

This post is a demonstration I use in my Web Scraping class for Eskwelabs. The goal is to scrape facebook posts (your own) and make a `Word Cloud` from it.

Data Science is not only about fancy algorithms, statistics and math. It is also about credibly sourcing your data. Given that the bulk of data is in the internet hiding in the backend or scattered in the frontend of websites, web scraping is indeed a handy technique.

The [Cambridge Analytica Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal) took its toll and changed the data mining landscape to a more stricter sense. Personal data of millions of Facebook users where scraped and used without consent for political advertising and campaign.

It was a good thing that in 2018, the European Union pushed through implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that puts privacy of people with their digital data at a premium.

Because of this a lot of companies mandated that their users will have the option to download their personal data (although it is unclear if these data is complete). At the very least we have a sense of ownership and visibility to our own data. If ever Facebook sells my info at least I know what info they got from me. And maybe reverse engineer their methods and find the truth.


Python```
import numpy as np

test = np.linspace(0,100,0.1)
```






we can clean out noise in the string. Technically we call them `stop words`.
