Reports from Commission on Elections (COMELEC) key persons and media outlets confirmed a
sudden plunge in percentage in the transmission results
around 92.89% at 5:45 am to 49.76% at 6:19 am. The results
returned to a 93.45% at 8:01 am. COMELEC commissioner Guanzon
explained that this fluctuation is due to a mere ‘java error’
and proclaimed that ‘there is nothing to worry about’.

After transmission to Municipal canvassing machines and
COMELEC central server, results are directed to the transparency
servers which third party and media can access to validate and safeguard.
The results reflecting from the transparency servers are vital
in affirming the accuracy, credibility and cleanliness of the
election. Discrepancy in this transmission line is a major issue,
this is something to worry about.

Many have expressed their frustration on the technical
issues on the election results transmission. COMELEC should
have done more rigorous quality assurance (QA) and preparation
as these are critical. We urge COMELEC to hold accountability
to the said issues and explain the chronology of the
transmission mishaps.
