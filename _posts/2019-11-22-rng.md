excerpt: "Random numbers generated from physical processes are vital our current mode of communication that
relies on the transmission of data through computer systems and networks. Our daily activities like
sending emails, browsing social media, online banking and shopping depend on these
telecommunication platforms and the world wide web secured by random numbers."

All of us encountered chance in one way or another. That guilty moment when guessing in a multiple-
choice exam, that heart-throbbing suspense when hoping that you draw your crush'’s name in the class
Christmas exchange gift, that spin the bottle game of truth or dare when drinking with friends, or even
that simple coin toss whether to eat out or not. Chance is entangled to our lives but ironically, most of
us find it hard to grasp or understand [1].


First time students of statistics and even novice teachers admit that statistics is a difficult field of study
as it go against common intuition [2]. In real life situations, most people feel uncomfortable when
confronted with the concept of randomness. There is this tendency to believe that things happen for a
reason and that there must be an explanation for the present state of things. These sentiments can be
traced back to the earliest writings and theological teachings of almost all civilizations [3].


Operational mathematics, in its manner and form, is largely based from the axioms, theorems and
propositions of the ancient Greeks. They did not pioneer rigid mathematical treatment of the theory of
randomness because; First, they believe that the future is governed by the will of gods. Second, they
believe on absolute truth proved by logical assumptions. And third, their number system is impractical
for calculations with fractions and non-positive numbers. These would imply that probabilities and
chance would be irrelevant and an impossibility for them [4].


The first advancement in the theory of randomness came much later when a medical doctor turned
gambler Gerolamo Cardano wrote a book titled ‘Book on the Games of Chance’ that depicts strategies
in playing card games, backgammon, and a primitive dice called the astragali [4]. This work by
Cardano became the basis of the works of Galileo Galilei (equiprobability of tossing three dice), Blaise
Pascal (fundamental counting theory and concept of mathematical expectation) and Jacob Bernoulli
(law of large numbers) [1].

Another notable contribution to the theory if randomness was from an Englishman shopkeeper by the
name of John Graunt. In his book ‘Natural and Political Observations Made Upon The Bills of
Mortality’, he was able to predict accurately the mortality rates of London in a 'normal' year and also
the number of casualties of a particular disease or incident [3].
