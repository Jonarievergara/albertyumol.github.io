The issue of the Jeepney phase out had caused
a myriad of clamors across the country by different
sectors through staged mobilizations, driver's strikes,
public consultations and debate with the administration.
It has been clear more than ever that the government does not see
itself as responsible for establishing a publicly owned and
operated transport system. They smoke-screen their agenda of
profiteering with private institutions and multi-national
companies with dubious promise of modernization, safety and efficiency.

LTFRB Chairman Delgra even boasts model units, implementations,
and pilot testing in Tacloban last January 26. He said that the
public was more than satisfied with the new cleaner and less
noisy Jeeps. But upon consultation with the locals, the Jeeps
operated only at the day of the launching and were only used
by VIPs and public officials. Delgra defended this by saying
that maybe the government officials we're in need of the
transportation system as well.

A firm analysis of concrete conditions of our worsening
transport system tells us that only with a mass transportation
system built upon the context of national industrialization can we
solve our transportation woes. This entails developing truly local
PUV manufacturing industries and the government investing in formal
mass transport.

Without a clear plan for mass transport solution,
the administration should instead support and subsidize existing
informal public transport alternatives especially the Jeepneys
which has taken up the slack and provided for the sorely need
services for our commuters.
