So I was commissioned to make a low-cost POS system for a small clinic in the Philippines. Oh boy was I excited when the client gave me the freedom to design everything from scratch and use any machine that I want.

As an open hardware and software junkie that I am (and very frugal might I add), I need to do it as low cost as I can. Everything should run from community supported technology.

Even though my background is Physics, I have been addicted to robotics and tinkering since high school. But since what I am doing nowadays are mostly 'data science' related, my making skills are getting rusted.

Another thing that sparked my excitement for this project.

Here are the specifications of my client:
+ have a database to store customer information (name, age, gender, date/time of visit, doctor assigned to) with tracking numbers
+ inventory of medicines, vaccines, products, services and procedures (e.g. ECG, 2D echo, holter monitoring), miscellaneous (lab tests, test kits, ear piercing)
+ end of the day cash report
+ option to apply discounts (senior, PWD, arbitrary)
+
