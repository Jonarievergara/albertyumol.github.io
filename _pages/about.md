<h2>Mabuhay daigdig!</h2>

Welcome to my blog. I am Albert Yumol but my friends call me ‘bash’. I am a self-proclaimed Linux and open-source junkie. I dream of becoming a storyteller. And this blog is the medium of my prose. Join me in my journey of self-realization through technology and innovation for the Filipino people.

<h2>Podcasts I Listen To</h2>

99% Invisible

<blockquote>
<small>Design is everywhere in our lives, perhaps most importantly in the places where we've just stopped noticing. 99% invisible is a weekly exploration of the process and power of design and architecture.

DataFramed

<blockquote>
<small>Data Science is one of the fastest growing industries and has been called the « Sexiest job of the 21st Century ». But what exactly is Data Science? In the podcast by DataCamp, Hugo Bowne-Anderson approaches this question from the perspective of what problems Data Science tries to solve instead of what definition fits it best. From automated medical diagnosis and self-driving cars to recommendation systems and climate change, come on a journey with industry and academic experts to explore the inner workings of the industry that will color the 21st century.</small>

<h2>Books that made me</h2>

The Drunkards Walk

<blockquote>
<small>The story of how randomness and random numbers changed us.</small>
</blockquote>

The Elements of Style

<blockquote>
<small>Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in the outline, but that every word tell.</small>
