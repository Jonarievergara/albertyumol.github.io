<h2>Mabuhay daigdig!</h2>

Welcome to my blog. I am Albert Yumol but my friends call me ‘bash’. I am a self-proclaimed Linux and open-source junkie. I dream of becoming a storyteller. And this blog is the medium of my prose. Join me in my journey of self-realization through technology and innovation for the Filipino people.
